# lirc does the following with this info:
# - play back header(long and short duration, these should be values in nanoseconds(?)): 3,4us pulse (modulated signal on), 1,7us pause (no signal)
# - send pre_data (24 bits), 1s are encoded by short pulse followed by long gap (0.4us and 1.2us), and zeros are short pulse and short gap (0.4us each)
# - send actual key data (same way as pre_data)
# that's it. no magic involved.
# note that this data includes some kind of checksum in last byte (compare arrow keys as an example)
#
# controls different camcorders (up to SD-707 and later) as well.
